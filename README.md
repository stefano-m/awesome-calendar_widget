# A Calendar Widget for the Awesome Window Manager

A simple widget that can be attached to the `textclock` to show a monthly
calendar.

This widget is a simple wrapper around `awful.widget.calendar_popup` available
in Awesome >= **4.2**

Once the widget is attached to the `textclock` (or any other widget really),
moving the mouse over the `textclock` will show a monthly calendar. The mouse
scroll down/up and left/right buttons will show the previous/next month
respectively.

Note that when using the `cal` utility, the widget has a very simple look, but
is quite quick to load.

# Installation

1. Copy `calendar.lua` in your `~/.config/awesome/` folder (e.g. by cloning
   this repository)
3. Restart Awesome (e.g. press `modkey + Control` or run `awesome-client
   "awesome.restart()"` from a terminal).

# Usage

For **Awesome 4.x**, add the following to your `~/.config/awesome/rc.lua`:

``` lua
-- If you just copied the file in ~/.config/awesome
local calendar = require("calendar")

-- If you cloned the repo as a submodule in
-- ~/.config/awesome/external/calendar
-- local calendar = require("external.calendar")

-- more configuration here

-- {{{ Wibar
-- Create a textclock widget
local mytextclock = wibox.widget.textclock()
calendar:register(mytextclock)

-- more configuration follows
```
